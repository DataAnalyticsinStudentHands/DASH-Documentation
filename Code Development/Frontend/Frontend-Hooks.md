Currently we use hooks in order to automate some actions before or after other cordova or git commands. For example, in the ArtApp, we have automated the addition of plugins before adding the platform as can be seen [here](https://github.com/DataAnalyticsinStudentHands/ArtApp/blob/prerelease/hooks/before_platform_add/add_plugins.js).
 
The folders in the hooks folder must be based off of already established hooks by Cordova or Git in order to be properly called upon.
