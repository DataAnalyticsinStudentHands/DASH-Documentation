##Steps for Compiling

In some repositories, steps 1-4 will be automated using `gulp android-setup` or `gulp ios-setup` and steps 4-5 via `gulp android-build` or `gulp ios-build`. Plugins may be automatically installed via add_plugins.js hook in `hooks\before_platform_add\`.

1. `cordova plugin ls` Ensure all plugins are already installed based on the documentation for the repository.

2. Cordova 5.0+ requires `cordova-plugin-whitelist`. Refer to configuration data for whitelist [here](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/4.0.0/guide_appdev_whitelist_index.md.html) and some applications may need to be upgraded when built.

3. Perform `cordova platform add ios` or `cordova platform add android`

4. Perform `ionic resources` to generate icon/splash assets based on those in `/resources` folder.

3. Perform `cordova build ios` or `cordova build android --release`.

    - On **android**, the last lines of the build message will have the path of the APK output.

    - On **iOS**, close xCode (if open) before building and reopen xCode by clicking on the [APP_NAME].xcodeproj file in `/platforms/iOS/`

4. After building, use xCode or adb commands to install the APK/IPA on the device.
