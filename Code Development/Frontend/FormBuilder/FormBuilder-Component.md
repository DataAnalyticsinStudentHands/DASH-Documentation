FormBuilder Component
=

A component is the basic form element of FormBuilder. It is the basic building block of the form and generally represents a single question.

#####Creating a New Component
This is done by simply registering the new component in the `.run` section of the app.js file.

Simply copy the following code and modify it to suit your needs.
```
    $builder.registerComponent('COMPONENT_NAME', {
        group: 'Default OR Other',
        label: 'LABEL_ME',
        required: false,
        templateUrl: 'partials/component/tmplCOMPONENT_NAME.html',
        popoverTemplateUrl: 'partials/component/popCOMPONENT_NAME.html'
    });
```
Component templates and popover templates can be easily created by using a similar, existing component and popover as a template to structure the new one. Beware of scope variables in the view that must be linked properly in order for everything to function properly.

#####Component Components

- Group - which tab it will be displayed in, in the editor
