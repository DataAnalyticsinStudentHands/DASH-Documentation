#Logging Notes

This [page](http://gordondickens.com/wordpress/2013/03/27/sawing-through-the-java-loggers/) describes the frameworks we use for logging(SLF4j and Logback). Another tutorial can be found [here](http://www.codingpedia.org/ama/how-to-log-in-spring-with-slf4j-and-logback/). A quick summary:

**Don't use `System.out` or `System.err`!** 

While debugging **System.out** and **System.err** will go to the console, but on the server these streams are not properly swallowed. Because of this, important information will not be logged. This is especially important if you use a try-catch block that is autogenerated by Eclipse or another IDE. Often these will simple do the following 

		try {
			//try block code
		} catch (Exception e) {
			// TODO Auto-generated catch block
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
This auto generated catch block uses printStackTrace(), which prints to **System.Err**, which will not be logged on the server. All of our logging code, including exception handling, should use the same SLF4j API. For example:
  
		import org.slf4j.Logger;
		import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
		public class MyClass {
		  private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyClass.class);
		
		  public void someMethod() {
		    logger.debug("something is happening");
		  }
		}

An alternative to `e.printStackTrace()` is the following:

		try {
			//try block code
		} catch (Exception e) {
			logger.debug("debugging info", e);
		}

The `logger.debug()` method will log the given message at the debugging level. Messages can be logged at different levels using similar methods such as `logger.error()`.

#Configure logging via Logback
Logback can be configured by adding Logback.xml to the class path.
