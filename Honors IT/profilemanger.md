#Profile Manager Settings

##Introduction
Mac OS X Profile Manager is ideally supposed to be responsible for controlling most of the settings on Macintosh computers. However, it is bad at its job and tends to corrupt its database every once in awhile. Therefore, we have moved most of the settings away from Profile Manager to their command-line equivalents. The eventual plan is to use Profile Manager to solely manage printing and mounting network shared at login, because those are tasks that it can complete without suffering from amnesia.
