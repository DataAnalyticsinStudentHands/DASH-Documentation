## Honors IT Documentation

Our online documentation can be found at [Honors FreshService](http://honorscollege.freshservice.com) The folder struture here mimics the structure inside the FreshService "Solutions" section. The documentation is written in Markdown. A cheatsheet for markdown can be found [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

To get started:

1. Clone of Fork https://github.com/DataAnalyticsinStudentHands/DASH-Documentation.git to your local computer
2. Edit or add the markdown files inside the folder Honors IT using the [Atom](https://atom.io/) editor or any suitable markdown editor
3. Preview the markdown files and then save them as HTML files
4. Copy the HTML file into the Solution [Honors FreshService](http://honorscollege.freshservice.com) The file name in GitHub should be reflected in the title of the Solution (e.g. the file [DASH-Documentation/Honors IT/Procedures/OpeningTasks.md](DASH-Documentation/Honors IT/Procedures/OpeningTasks.md) can be found as "Opening Task (Morning)" inside Procedures in the Solutions section)
5. Don't forget to commit/push your changes.
