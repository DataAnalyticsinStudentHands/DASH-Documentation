1. If the outside device will sit at the A/V cart, connect it to HDMI 1 or Computer 2 via VGA. There are cables in the A/V cart cabinet and adapters in the "Display" drawer in the IT room. 

2. If the speaker's laptop will be on the podium, use the Optoma projector (located behind the Sharp TV in IT Storage) and connect audio from the laptop directly to the podium (don't use the a/v cart speaker).

NOTE: Never dismantle the a/v cart! If think you have to dismantle it, you should be using the Optoma projector.
