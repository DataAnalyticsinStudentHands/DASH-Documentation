If someone wants to borrow something out of IT, whether it is a laptop or a power strip, they need to sign off on a sign-out sheet. Follow these guidelines:

1. Whenever possible, the same person should sign under "borrower". One faculty member should not return another's equipment, but it is possible that one will not have the same SSO worker returning equipment as taking it.
2. If there is a ticket involved with the lending of equipment, do not close the ticket until the equipment has been returned and signed off on.
3. Always use asset tag for the description column whenever possible. It is the most precise descriptor we have.
4. Be as descriptive as necessary, and use multiple lines whenever needed.

A (fake) example is included below. This is to be replaced by an actual sign-out sheet when possible.
