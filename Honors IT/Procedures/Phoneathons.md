#Setup for Phoneathons

Phoneathons are when the Honors college gets some students together and cold calls prospective students to advertise the Honors College. To get this done, essentially the computer lab will be turned into a miniature call center.

The students will be given headsets and take up computers in the lab, following these instructions:

1) Login with your cougarnet.2) Press (command+spacebar) then type lync and press enter.3) Click Accept, check Do not show this message again, and click Don't change.4) Enter hcapply@central.uh.edu in the email address, hcapply in the User ID, and enter the password given to you at the event, and press enter.5) Click Phone and use the on-screen number pad to make phone calls.6) When done, simply close Lync and log off.Password for hcapply changes every 90 days and the students will be told what it is at the phoneathon.
