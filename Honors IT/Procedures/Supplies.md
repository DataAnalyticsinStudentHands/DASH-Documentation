If one of the printers is low on toner, please let Brenda Ramirez (bramirez3@uh.edu, 713-743-0813) know. She will order new toner. In the meantime you can find new printer cartridges close to the printers or in her office. She also orders all kinds of other stuff (like staples for the print and office materials).
