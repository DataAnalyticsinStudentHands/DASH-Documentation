## UH IT Case Management

We need to create a UH IT cases for all work that has to be performed by UH IT (e.g. DNS requests, open data ports etc.). Open a case on this page:  https://ssl.uh.edu/wtsc_apps/infotech/tickets/case-management/index.php

You should login using a Cougarnet Login, depending on the case.


### Open a Data Port

Due to the expansion of the Honors College, sometimes faculty and staff members find themselves moved to rooms and locations where the network drops are inactive. Reactivating the data ports is a priority so that they can work work uninterrupted.

To activate a data jack, and select "Open a new case related to Telecommunications or Work Orders".

On the lefthand side of the next page, there will initially be one dropdown menu. Click it and select "Network Services." A second dropdown menu will appear. Click it and select "Data Port Activation." (NOTE: There is an option for activating 5 or more data jacks at the same time. Select this option if multiple jacks need to be activated IN THE SAME ROOM. If 6 jacks need to be activated in the Large Classroom, then the "5 or more" option would be the correct one. However, if there are 5 jacks total that need to be activated between the Large Classroom and Martel, then each room must have its own work order.) Finally, a third dropdown menu will appear. Click it and select "Add."

On the right side, there are fields to fill out. You are the primary point of contact so fill out the proper information in the "Primary Customer" tab. Fill out the "Employee" tab as best you can with the information of the professor that you are filling the work order for. FInally, fill out the "Service Location" tab.The department will be "Dean, Honors College." If the request is for the MD Anderson library space, just fill out the dropdown boxes with the proper information. If for some reason the required information is not available in the dropdown menu (filing a work orer for Moody, etc.), you are able to type the required information in the relevant fields.

Submit and case when completed and keep the confirmation email for reference.
