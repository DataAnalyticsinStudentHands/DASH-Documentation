# Keeping Munki up to Date

## Monday
**Check to see if software was deployed over the weekend.** Go into e-mail, see if new packages are available. Go into Munki, check for new packages, version updates, etc show up in testing. Remote access hc-deployment, autopkgr will be up, check to see if recipes have run. If doubtful, ‘run all recipes’.

## Tuesday

**Begin testing new updates and software.** Be thorough. Go through Menus and try out each function. Does the software work? Is it able to move between accounts? Can you sign in? Is all of your data present? Does data transfer well and completely? Questions like these. (Move software into testing,  take note of the version, go through menus trying out each function, be thorough)

## Wednesday

**Check for new software. Continue testing. If there are any problems, document them clearly.** Be specific. Try and figure out what is going wrong and where. (when done testing an update, put into available category, put into each manifest, if needed, create a ticket for it in freshservice)

## Thursday

**Review day. Check previous days documentation.** Make sure documentation and testing are clearly defined. Does documentation match up with what you see on screen? Is software where documentation says it is? Is functionality stated clearly and reflected in documentation? If documentation is unclear in any way, make sure to update it clearly. Make sure documentation is up to date so far. (document in munki portion of solutions, in freshservice. Update daily)

## Friday

**Finish testing. Finish documentation.** Everything should be up to date at this point. Move approved and tested packages to ‘Available’, double check manifests.
