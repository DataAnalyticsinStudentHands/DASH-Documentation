#Honors College User/Computer Classes

The Honors College requires certain software packaged on its client computers to ensure the college runs smoothly. There are three classes of users in the Honors College, each with their own lists of packages. All packages will be imported into Munki for distrubtion, but certain software may require some work to create a distributable package.

Classes are determined and assigned by computer. For example, the computers in SSO will be imaged and configured as Advisor computers, but if someone who works in SSO were to login in the computer lab, they would only be able to access software available to all lab users.

In addition to software, each class has different restrictions and login scripts.
