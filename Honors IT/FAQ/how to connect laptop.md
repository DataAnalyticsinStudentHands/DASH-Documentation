# How to Connect Your Laptop to the Projector

## For HDMI Setup

If your laptop has an HDMI port – first, connect the HDMI cable to the HDMI port on your laptop. Next, locate the projector remote.

Press ‘HDMI’ button on the remote, and wait a few seconds for projector to reflect laptop display.

## For VGA Setup

If your laptop has a VGA port – first, connect the VGA cable to the VGA port on your laptop. If connection feels loose, gently turn the knobs on either side of the VGA connector to the right to tighten. Next, locate the projector remote.

Press the ‘PC’ button on the remote until 'Computer 2' appears in the bottom right corner of the screen, and wait a few seconds for projector to reflect laptop display.

NOTE: If you are using a MAC, and it lacks both an HDMI and VGA port – contact HONORS IT for an adapter.

*Please press ‘PC’ to toggle back to the 'Computer 1'(visible in the bottom right corner of the screen) original projector display. If you don’t, Honors IT will put your soul in a computer and you will be forever filled with existential dread.*
