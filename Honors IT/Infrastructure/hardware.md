The Honors College uses several types of hardware to provide a seamless computing experience to its faculty, staff and students.

## Servers

For deployment and management of the IT infrastructure we use two Mac Mini 5.1 headless computers with Core i5 processors and 16 GB of RAM, one at the MD Anderson Library and one at the Honors Gardens.

We have another Mac Mini 5.1 headless computer to serve as FileMaker server. It is located in the IT office at the MD Anderson Library.

## Storage

We use a [Synology DS415+](https://www.synology.com/en-global/products/DS415+) NAS device with 24 TB of storage in a RAID 5 to provide network backup and file services. Documentation is attached below. The configuration interface can be reached at http://hc-storage.cougarnet.uh.edu:5000/
