There are several different printers at the Honors College, but they're all HP Printers or Sharp Copiers. Printers are now a self-service operation, managed through Munki. Settings for each printer are created in Profile Manager, and deployed through Munki. Each printer has a static IP address to remove it from the DHCP Pool.

## Setup
All the printers have a web interface that can be reached via IP address. The login for the Xerox machines is admin (1111). They are configured to send alert emails to honorsit@central.uh.edu and other (e.g. Brenda Ramirez for supplies).

## Supplies
We keep supplies for printers close to the locations of the printers. But most of our stock is in Brenda Ramirez' office. Most of the printers are sending emails to Brenda Ramirez. If you notice something is missing, please get in contact with her.

When the part comes in, install it and return the empty cartridge to Brenda. We are recycling printer supplies.

## Installing a Printer

* Open Managed Software Center located in ```Applications``` -> ```Utilities```.
* Select **Install** for the desired printer.


## Removing a Printer

* Open Managed Software Center.
* Select **Remove** for the desired printer.
