When copying a book, or other object that prevents the copier top from closing, you must manually delete the margins to prevent black margins, which depletes the toner, and increases the likelihood of the printer getting jammed. To do this, touch Copy>Others>Erase, select the margins and set them to ¼”- ½” (in most cases this should be sufficient), then touch the blue ‘ok’ and proceed to copy as you normally would. Thank you.
