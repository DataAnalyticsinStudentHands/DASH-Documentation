### Introduction

Munki is a set of tools that, used together with a webserver-based repository of packages and package metadata, can be used by OS X administrators to manage software installs (and in many cases removals) on OS X client machines.

Our Munki repository is hosted at `//hc-storage/web/munki`

If you are new to Munki, here is a helpful guide. This will tell you a little more about how to setup a Munki server and deployment of software.
