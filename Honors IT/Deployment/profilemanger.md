We only use Mac OS X Profile Manager to solely manage printing and mounting network shared at login. Those settings will then be imported for distribution via Munki and are based on User/Computer class.

The settings generated with the Profile Manager are named `*.mobileconfig`. Please refer to the "Software List" document about specific settings generated.

The Profile Manager has been setup on HC-Deployment (using Server.app) and accessible via: https://curly.cougarnet.uh.edu/
Please use Safari to open the link (doesn't work in Chrome!).

To generate a setting open Profile Manager and go to "Device Groups".

## Examples for Settings generated with the Profile Manager
