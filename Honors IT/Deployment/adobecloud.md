honorit@central.uh.edu is an administrative account for the Honors Adobe Cloud Team license (password can be found in SecretServer)

That means, that Honors IT can manage the license and we donâ€™t have to bother Martha with adding team members. Martha Hayes is still the primary contact on the team license.

Please note, that the Honors IT account is not using any of the licenses that we buy through the team. The named licenses to actually use the Adobe Cloud software are currently for:

1. Martha Hayes

2. Julia Brown



Number 3 will hopefully show up today and will be given to Adrian Castillo.

The renewal date on our licenses shows up as November 30, 2017.

Please also remember that we will want to add Jennifer Hennessey to the team when her individual license expires.

License renewal (yearly) and adding of new licenses should be done through CougarByte.
