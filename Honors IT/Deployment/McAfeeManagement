This is a WIP solution, so I will add to this as I go -Trent

Key distinctions:

**McAfee ePO(**[https://epo5:8443](https://epo5:8443)**):** Website that is hosted by UHIT and can remotely manage the McAfee Agent

**McAfee Agent:** local Software so ePO can contact and manage computers

**McAfee Endpoint Security:** Full software suite that is the virus protection
    

**McAfee Agent**

**UPDATING THE AGENT:**

The lastest version of the McAfee Agent can be downloaded from the McAfee ePO website (do this if there is a new agent available):


1\. Log on to the ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO) console.

2\. Click Menu, Systems, System Tree, and then click New Systems(at the top).

3\. Click "Create and download agent installation package"

4\. Select "non-Windows" Version and select the "Current" Mac OSX package

5\. Click "Selected Agent Handler" bubble

6\. Click "OK" at the bottom

7\. Click link  to download and unzip the file

8\. Replace the install.sh at hc-storage.cougarnet.uh.edu/scripts/install.sh with the new file


**INSTALLING THE AGENT:**

If the computer is listed as "Unmanaged" on the ePO website, it is possible to push the install script from Apple Remote Desktop:

**Ask someone in charge before you push it to a server like hc-deployment, as it could cause issues.**

curl http://hc-storage.cougarnet.uh.edu/scripts/install.sh -o /Users/hcadmin/install.sh

/usr/bin/sudo /bin/bash /Users/hcadmin/install.sh **(ADD FLAGS FROM PICTURE ABOVE HERE, normally -i for fresh install)**
 

**McAfee Endpoint Security Installation:**

This needs to be pushed from the ePO website after the computer is listed as "Managed"

**Ask someone in charge before you push it to a server like hc-deployment, as it could cause issues.**

On the ePO website:
Put a check next to the system you want to install Endpoint Security on then go Actions > Tag > Apply tag > 1SoftwareDeployment > UIT\_OSX\_Install\_ENSM\_10.2.3
The software will install the next time the agent talks to the server – it could range from 5 minutes to 2 or so hours before that happens. **Then remove the tag once you confirm the software is installed.** You can see the installed software by double clicking the system and checking the products tab.
