## Imaging A Computer

1. First, make sure your computer is connected to the network via ethernet.
2. Then, restart the computer. After the start up 'chime', hold down the N key.
3. This will cause the computer to boot from the network and connect to ActiveDirectory.
  * The admin password has not been updated, so you will not be logged in automatically. Until it is updated, there will be a NSURLErrorDomain error -1012. You can ignore this.
4. After naming the computer, you will be directed to a list of possible profiles to choose from. Select your desired profile, then press the 'play' button.
5. When prompted, enter an admin account username and password to bind computer to the domain. After completing the process, computer will restart.
6. If everything works properly, computer will complete binding to ActiveDirectory upon restart.
