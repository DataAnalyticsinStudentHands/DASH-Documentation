# Windows Computer Backups

## Introduction
The Honors College's backups are handled via [Veeam Backup Endpoint Free Edition](https://www.veeam.com/vmware-esxi-vsphere-virtualization-tools-hyper-v-products.html#free). This software needs to be installed manually on a Windows computer. The backups are stored on the "Backups" shared drive on the Synology NAS (hc-storage).

### Which computers get backed up?
We only back up user directories of faculty and staff Windows computers.
