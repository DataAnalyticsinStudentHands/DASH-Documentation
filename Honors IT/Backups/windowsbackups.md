# Windows Computer Backups

## Introduction
The Honors College's backups are handled via Veeam Free Edition. This software needs to be installed manually on a Windows computer. The backups are stored on the "Backups" share on the Synology NAS.

### Which computers get backed up?
We only back up user directories of faculty and staff Windows computers.
